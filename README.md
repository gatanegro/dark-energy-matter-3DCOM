## In the novel framework: 3D Collatz Octave Model (3DCOM), space, mass, and time emerge from recursive wave interactions governed by a topological attractor field. ##

We derive a dimensionless dark energy density Ω_Λ as a residual curvature effect from incomplete recursive mirroring. The derived formula:
Ω_Λ = HQS × (π/2 + LZ + √α + π/(100))

numerically evaluates to 0.6868153680976859, closely matching the Planck observational value of 0.6847 ± 0.0073.

Each term reflects a geometric or energetic constraint: 

- HQS = 0.235 is the harmonic quantum shift representing recursive energy loss, 
- LZ= 1.23498228 is the attractor recursion limit from a topological 3-sphere structure,
- √α couples the electromagnetic phase amplitude,  
- π/100 encodes the fine angular correction (1.8°) preventing phase closure at 90°. 

This model replaces the notion of a vacuum with an uncollapsed recursive field whose invisible component (90° behind visible mass nodes) is misinterpreted as dark energy. In this view, Ω_Λ quantifies the systemic asymmetry of incomplete recursion across cosmic structure.

 # 6.1 Observer Angle (Qualia Operator Q∧)
      The user can rotate the angle of vision through a recursive 3D COM field.
      This angle controls which recursive nodes collapse into visible qualia (mass, color, etc.).
 6.2 Bridge Formula Fusion
      At every visible node (from a certain angle), the tool applies the Bridge Formula:
        
      It outputs the observable value (radius, energy, color shift) at that node from that observer angle.
 6.3 COM Recursive Field Engine
      Underlying space is stacked recursive octaves, populated by Collatz - reduced points.
      Nodes are energy attractors, invisible unless aligned with observer axis.
      
# What the Software Could Let You Do:

- Feature
- Function
- Rotate observer angle
- Change θ_obs to see different recursive nodes (what “collapses” into visibility).
- 
 Zoom recursion scale

- Explore how scaling in COM affects perceived values.
- See Bridge Formula output
 
Each node reveals computed energy, radius, or frequency from the Bridge. 

Qualia visualization

Color of node changes with observer angle → angle = color.

 Show invisible 90° recursion
 
- Behind every node, faintly render orthogonal recursion → dark field.
- Save simulation states
- Store specific angle + output pairs for further analysis.


      3D COM Recursive Field from Collatz sequences reduced into Octave rings.
      Observer Angle Slider (°) simulates rotating the observer's Qualia perspective.
  
      Nodes turn red when their angular alignment matches the observer's angle (~±15°).
      Matching nodes display Bridge Formula output with calculated radius values.
  
 # What This Shows:
 
      Perceived nodes depend purely on observer’s angular alignment.
      
      Only aligned nodes collapse into "matter", all others stay as invisible recursive field.
      
      The Bridge Formula activates only for visible attractors.

 Observer-Angle Simulation with Bridge Formula Overlay using the 3D Collatz Octave Model:
 
 ## How to Use:##
    1. Paste and run the code in a Python environment with GUI capability (like Jupyter Notebook with %matplotlib, or any Python script runner).
    2. Use the slider to rotate the observer angle (θ_obs) in degrees.
    3. Red nodes are visible attractors from the current observer angle.
    4. The Bridge Formula output appears below for those visible nodes (based on recursion layer n).
